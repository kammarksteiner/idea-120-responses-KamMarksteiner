A WMD, or Weapon of Math Destruction as Cathy O’Neil describes, is a mathematical algorithm that causes real-world negative effects. Many WMDs analyse millions of people, and judge them based on rules and algorithms. The effects of these judgements may mean that certain people may be barred from certain jobs or actions, negatively affecting their livelihood. Additionally, many of these algorithms are not entirely optimised, picking out people who may be acting unusually due to unaccounted circumstances. As O’Neil states, the three main elements of a WMD are opacity, scale, and damage.

One example of a WMD described by O’Neil is the Level of Service Inventory-Revised (LSI-R), a questionnaire intended for prisoners to fill out in order to decide their chances of recidivism. The LSI-R uses the prisoners’ answers to categorise them as high, medium, or low risk, with many states basing the prisoners’ sentence on this score. Many of the questions asked on this questionnaire are highly biased and unjust, asking about matters such as whether they have been arrested in the past, whether they think they were the one most at fault for their crime, or if any of their friends and family have been arrested. While on the surface these questions may seem appropriate, the answers to these questions will often be largely different based on one’s race or home. For example, young black men are more likely to have been stopped by police far more times than other races, and are thus at a higher risk of being arrested, and people from relatively poorer suburbs are more likely to know people who have criminal records. According to the LSI-R, these two uncontrollable factors make a prisoner more likely to rescind.

The LSI-R follows all 3 of O’Neil’s elements of WMDs. In terms of opacity, while the prisoners can guess that the answers of the questionnaire are going to be used to judge their sentence, they do not know how they are scored, or the algorithm being used, and are given as little information as possible about the questionnaire. As for scale, the LSI-R is used as the main tool in 24 US states. The third component is damage, which is most noticeable about the LSI-R. This questionnaire has the capacity to majorly affect someone’s life and place them into a feedback loop of arrests through no fault of their own. A person who comes from a low-income neighbourhood may score higher on the test, meaning they may be imprisoned for far longer, also meaning that they make bonds with fellow criminals, which may increase their likelihood of recidivism. Additionally, many prisoners with longer sentences often rescind as they do not know or remember how to function in society. Additionally, they will have a harder time finding housing or work due to their criminal record. In all, the LSI-R is a classic example of a WMD, weaponising maths and data against the lives of real people.
