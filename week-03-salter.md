# Gesamtkunstwerk
Numerous contemporary tools can be used to create art that may be considered *Gesamtkunstwerk*. These tools may be either physical or digital, and have been used for the past few centuries to create art that functions more as an experience than as a simple item to view. Richard Wagner coined the term *Gesamtkunstwerk* in the early 1900’s, pioneering the practice with his opera *Der Ring des Nibelungen*, based on the German epic *Nibelungenlied*. Wagner built an entire theatre for his opera, using various forms of *Gesamtkunstwerk* to bring the audience into the experience. Some of these features included hiding the band under the audience, using dim lighting only around the stage that left the audience in darkness, and special acoustics, all to ensure that the audience had no distractions from the play. The unique acoustics of the theatre also made the sound reverberate under the audience stands, making the audience feel a physical sensation to further immerse themselves in the story. Perhaps most importantly, Wagner made the stage almost the same size as the audience seats, allowing him to set the stage much further away from the spectators. He also added a large frame around the outside of the stage area. In doing this, he intended for the audience to feel as if they were looking at a moving picture, and to incite an almost dream-like feeling. Wagner created his own space wherein he could control every aspect of how the audience views and interacts with his artwork, and in using various tools, he allowed the audience to suspend their disbelief and immerse themselves in the art.

Though Wagner may have pioneered *Gesamtkunstwerk*, his successors took the concept and built on it, introducing more contemporary tools to create new and interesting effects to draw the audience into the artwork. Taking Wagner’s ideas to a whole new level, Farkas Molnár conceptualised a mechanically changing environment that he dubbed the *U-Theater*. The theatre would dispense odours, as well as moving the audience itself, breaking down the separation between the audience and the art. In a much simpler vein, some Futurists would perform in public, bringing the art to the audience instead of the other way around. By doing this, the natural environment, such as the sound of passing cars, the temperature, or even the strength of the wind, would shape and influence the experience of the art. The audience, and those in the surrounding environment, would inform the art, rather than the art controlling the audience. These are just a few of the near-infinite ways *Gesamtkunstwerk* can be integrated into art to make a new and invigorating experience for an audience, and as time and technology progresses, artists will find more and more tools to help them in their explorational journey.
