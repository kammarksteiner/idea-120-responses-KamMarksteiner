I agree with a lot of what Bridle has to say. I, too, grew up using the internet from a very young age, and while I do not think I would be the person I am now without the unrestricted internet access I had as a child, I do not think that is the best idea for generations moving forwards. As Bridle mentions, I also do not want to be a hypocrite when talking about these issues, however the internet has changed quite a lot from when I was a child, and so has my opinion on it.

I agree with Bridle that the content churned out and fed to children on YouTube and other platforms today is not safe in any way for children so young to be watching. Much of the content features terrifying and shocking imagery inappropriate for the audience the channel is advertising to. In short, unsafe content is being fed to children without the knowledge of their caregivers. I think that Bridle does not have a “specific vision of what the internet ‘should be,’” as the question asks, but moreso a vision of what should be accessible on children’s content platforms like YouTube Kids. I agree with his vision, and think that far more safety precautions should be being taken on platforms like this.
