Murray’s predictions about internet television and inhabiting virtual environments was quite successful. Internet television is a massive phenomenon that has experienced a boom in the last decade or so, with the rise of streaming platforms. Having been written in 1997, Murray was less than a decade away from experiencing the first popular form of internet television with YouTube’s development in 2005. Today, cable television is almost obsolete, as broadcasting companies have instead created numerous streaming platforms, allowing viewers to watch the television through the internet. Murray also alludes to the fact that putting television online would allow audiences to stream episodes on-demand, which was an incredibly accurate prediction.

As for inhabiting virtual spaces, Murray describes this moreso akin to the concept of Virtual Reality, as she alludes more to viewers participating in virtual spaces. While VR does exist today, it is not at the level that Murray likely envisioned in her text, though fragments of this technology appear in virtual sets like in The Mandalorian. In the show, the actors are inhabiting the virtual environment rather than the viewer as Murray suggests, though the viewer does still participate by watching the finished product and becoming immersed in the world of The Mandalorian. Again, while Murray discusses something similar to modern VR (using a controller and headset/screen to move around and view an environment), The Mandalorian creates a physical LED-powered digital set (dubbed The Volume) around the actors. By doing this, the actor is brought physically into the digital environment, rather than having to connect in using additional devices. The Volume acts as a digital environment, bringing the actors into the digital set and allowing for better acting, as well as aiding the more technical side with lighting, sets, and budget. The actors are able to feel as if they are acting in a real desert, while the showmakers are still able to create ‘realistic’ and believable alien planets for the viewers. While Murray was slightly off with her predictions on inhabiting virtual environments, that does not mean this technology will not come to pass in the future.
