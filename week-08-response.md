It is incredibly important to be critical of the information you find online. Chalabi describes many ways of doing this, specially with statistics, and while I do try to hold myself to these practices, it is easy to forget from time-to-time to truly analyse the origins and meanings of these statistics. One important analysis I always try to do, that Chalabi very briefly mentioned, is to consider the scale of a statistic, and the wordage used. For example, reporting that something has increased 300% is the same as saying it has increased from a total of 0.03 to 0.09, yet both wordages and scales give completely different pictures to the reader about what is happening.

I believe that targeted ads and similar means of shaping interactions are not bad as a whole, yet these practices can be used to further dangerous means. It is possible for content to be targeted towards certain people for predatory means, such as political agendas. One example of this is an old FaceBook controversy, in which the company was using targeted political ads that included blatant misinformation and lies to possibly sway the 2016 election. In this way, targeted media can be dangerous and non-egalitarian. On the other hand, targeted and shaped media can be useful to educate people, when handled correctly, and to show information and media to groups that will actually be interested in the content. While I do not think that targeted ads and other similar media shaping practices are outright bad, I do think that there should be stricter regulations on what can and cannot be advertised and targeted, as well as who can be targeted (eg. not targeting ads to children).
