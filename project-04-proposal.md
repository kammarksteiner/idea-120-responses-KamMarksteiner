For my portfolio, I am going to make a home page for my site that has a small preview of all my projects. Clicking on them will lead to a seperate page where you can learn more about the project and see it in full size. I will also obe doing a fourth project to put in my portfolio. I currently plan on making a drawing using TextMode Art. This style of art can be described as ASCII art or similar. I feel like this art style fits in well with the semester's curriculum, and will reflect many of the aspects we've explored.

The colour pallet of my website will likely either be a black background with white text as I like this style and find it's easy on the eyes, or a lighter pallet with the main colour being yellow as it is my favourite and I feel reflects me well.
